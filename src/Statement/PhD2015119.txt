Good Afternoon Sir.

I purchased Samsung E7 around 4 months ago from an authorised retailer in Delhi..
14:38:37
Namrata
I can understand your concern, surely I will help you regarding your concern.
14:38:48
and I was using the "Google Keyboard" properly(set as default) in the Kitkat operating system instead of the samsung keyboard
14:39:31
however after a recent update to Android Lolipop even when i change the default keyboard to Google Keyboard, after some time it switches it back to Samsung Keyboard...
14:40:35
Namrata
We regret for the inconvenience caused to you.
14:41:49
Namrata
May I have your contact details and State name so that we can check the details?
14:41:52
Yesterday I contacted one of your technicians via this chat and he asked me to delete BadgeProvider Data and reset app preferences
14:41:58
but that too only temporarily fixed the issue...
14:42:14

14:42:35
Could you kindly help?
